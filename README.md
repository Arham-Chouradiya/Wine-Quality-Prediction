**Project Name:** Wine Quality Prediction

**Description:**
This project aims to predict the quality of wines based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains information about different attributes of wines, such as acidity, pH levels, alcohol content, and more. By analyzing these features, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine the quality of wines.

**File Included:**
- `Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for the wine quality prediction project.

**Features:**
The dataset contains the following features:
1. Fixed acidity
2. Volatile acidity
3. Citric acid
4. Residual sugar
5. Chlorides
6. Free sulfur dioxide
7. Total sulfur dioxide
8. Density
9. pH
10. Sulphates
11. Alcohol

**Target Variable:**
- Quality: The quality of wine, typically represented as a score ranging from 3 to 8.

**Machine Learning Approach:**
The Random Forest Classifier will be utilized to build the predictive model. Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It's well-suited for this task due to its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features, as well as its robustness to noisy data and feature interactions.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
The performance of the models will be evaluated using accuracy score.

**Instructions:**
1. Ensure that all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. You can install them using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Wine Quality Prediction.ipynb` to execute the code and see the analysis.
3. Follow along with the provided code comments and markdown cells for a clear understanding of each step in the process.
4. Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
5. Feel free to reach out for any questions or suggestions regarding the project.
